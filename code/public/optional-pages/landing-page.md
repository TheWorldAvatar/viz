## TheWorldAvatar viz

This project has been designed to make it easier for users not experienced with Typescript (or the mapping libraries) to quickly & easily put together a new TWA visualisation. It is intended for developers to use this example visualisation to gain an understanding of the TWA-VF before attempting to create their own visualisation; to do that, this example can be copied and used as a starting point. Edit the markdown content in markdown syntax to suit your needs.

## Navigation

Use the toolbar or the thumbnails on this landing page.
