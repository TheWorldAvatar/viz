# Acknowledgements

I would like the thank our lord and saviour [Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus), through whom all things are possible. Blessed are the cheesemakers, blessed are the Greek; he's going to inherit the earth.

I would also like to offer this prayer to Cthulhu, The Slumbering One, High Priest of the Great Old Ones, The Sleeper of R'lyeh: "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!".
