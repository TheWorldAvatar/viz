# Tutorial

This directory provides a starter guide for new users to setup and deploy a sample visualisation platform.

Copy the contents of the `images/defaults` and `images/utils` directory [here](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/tree/main/web/twa-vis-platform/uploads/images/defaults) into this directory's `images` path. Copy the contents of the `example/uploads` directory into your required directory path. Start your visualisation following any of the deployment workflow.

The original `uploads` [directory](https://github.com/cambridge-cares/TheWorldAvatar/tree/main/web/twa-vis-platform/uploads) hosts the minimal setup required to run the platform.

For stack deployments, ensure the `vip.json` config is added to the `stack-manager/inputs/config/services` directory and start the stack with the added service.
